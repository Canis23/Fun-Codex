# Fun-Codex

This repo contains a simple .NET 8 Web API project named `WebApi`.

To run the project:

```bash
dotnet run --project WebApi
```

The API uses a simple controller/service structure. Swagger UI is available in
the Development environment. Once the project is running, navigate to
`http://localhost:5142/swagger` (or the URL shown in the terminal) to view the
available endpoints, including the `GET /hello-test` endpoint which returns a
simple greeting.
